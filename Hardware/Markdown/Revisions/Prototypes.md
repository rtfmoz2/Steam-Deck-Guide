    - Valve engineering prototype number 34 steamdeck unit.
    - This appears to be a fairly early revision as it still has the circular touchpads and a right joystick versus an analog stick, this does not have any OS installed on it. It does howerever, have an installed 256GB NvME SSD.
    - The left touchpad is loose. That's how I got it. It looks like the two wires to run the viration feedback have been disconnected.
    - It only boot to bios no further testing done.
