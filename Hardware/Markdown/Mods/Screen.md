        - The maker recommends installing the custom BIOS before swapping the screen, the old LCD screen won't - work use an external monitor
        - There will be tools included such as: plastic picks, a suction cup, a screwdriver etc...
        - The video shows the screen running at 80hz at 1080p
        - The screen might be oriented the wrong way in desktop mode, it can easily be fixed within the Display Configuration
        - Apparently sometimes ("1/3 chance") the screen might be missing colors which can be quickly fixed by entering / exiting sleep mode, hopefully fixed in future BIOS update
        - There might be a slight flash (line) when changing modes (like booting up, exiting gamescope etc...)
        - There might be a script & a Decky Loader plugin so brightness works correctly in desktop and gaming mode

    - Anti-glare screen protectors usually make the image less sharp but can drastically improve outside gaming experience
    - Glossy screens can be made "matte" and etched ones can be made glossy with screen protectors ([Etched to glossy example](https://youtu.be/7FKJODmcdiM?si=cbwKTfyTI6YoDUc_&t=161))
