# Gaming On The Steam Deck

## Quick Settings

### Brightness Slider / HDR
- For HDR to work on compatible displays (eg. OLED Steam Deck internal screen) these are the requirements:
    - Play in Gaming Mode (HDR only works on Wayland, Desktop Mode uses X11)
    - Game supports HDR and is enabled in the settings
    - Game is set to fullscreen mode
    - Helpful commands:
        - For some games that run outside of the Steam library - ```DXVK_HDR=1 PROTON_ENABLE_AMD_AGS=1 %command%```
        - For certain games ```SteamDeck=0 %command%``` and ```-dx12``` or ```-d3d12```
- Some information here is copied from and additional useful things [can be in this guide by u/mytrixx on r/SteamDeck regarding HDR](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1868qyv/steam_deck_oled_hdr_games_guide/)
- Two-tone slider explanation:
    - First part adjusts the brightness via the display hardware which changes how strongly each pixel lights up.
    - Second half adjusts the brightness via digital gain on the image we send to the display.

## Performance

### Battery
- Shows battery level in %
- Calculates remaining battery life in hours and minutes based on current power usage

### Performance Overlay Level
- Off: No overlay 
- 1: FPS only in top left corner
- 2: FPS, Frametime, CPU, GPU, RAM, VRAM, Battery, Power Usage and Time information in a row at the top of the screen
- 3: Same as level 2 but a tiny bit more detailed and on the left side
- 4: Everything on the left side

**To use settings below you need to be in ```Advanced View``` instead of ```Basic View```**

### Performance Settings

#### Use per-game profile
- Toggle to use saved Performance Settings for currently running game

#### Frame Limit
- Sets framerate and display refresh rate limit
    - Optimal settings:
        - LCD (60hz screen): 30 / 40 / 60
        - OLED (90hz scree): 30 / 45 / 90

#### Disable Frame Limit
- Allows the Deck to go beyond the highest frame limit

#### Allow Tearing
- By default the Deck uses some form of sync so there isn't tearing on the screen making the image smoother with the downside of more input lag
- [Currently this option doesn't seem to work](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/issues/1391)

#### Half Rate Shading

#### TDP Limit

#### Manual GPU Clock
- In certain situations its more beneficial to set this manually

#### Scaling Mode
- Auto:
- Integer:
- Fit:
- Stretch:
- Fill:

#### Scaling Filter
- Linear:
- Pixel:
- Sharp:

#### Show Perf Overlay In Steam
- Enables the performance overlay to show up when not playing a game in gaming mode (browsing menus)

#### Reset to Default
- Resets settings to their default value

    - Set resolution
        - Use FSR / XeSS upscaling / frame-generation
