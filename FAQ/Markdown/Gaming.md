# Gaming On The Steam Deck

## Quick Settings

### Brightness Slider / HDR
- For HDR to work on compatible displays (eg. OLED Steam Deck internal screen) these are the requirements:
    - Play in Gaming Mode (HDR only works on Wayland, Desktop Mode uses X11)
    - Game supports HDR and is enabled in the settings
    - Game is set to fullscreen mode
    - Helpful commands:
        - For some games that run outside of the Steam library - ```DXVK_HDR=1 PROTON_ENABLE_AMD_AGS=1 %command%```
        - For certain games ```SteamDeck=0 %command%``` and ```-dx12``` or ```-d3d12```
- Some information here is copied from and additional useful things [can be in this guide by u/mytrixx on r/SteamDeck regarding HDR](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1868qyv/steam_deck_oled_hdr_games_guide/)
- Two-tone slider explanation:
    - First part adjusts the brightness via the display hardware which changes how strongly each pixel lights up.
    - Second half adjusts the brightness via digital gain on the image we send to the display.
