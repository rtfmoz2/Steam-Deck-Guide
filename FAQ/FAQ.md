## Is The Steam Deck A Good Choice For You?

### Pricing
- Most likely the Deck will be the cheapest option new if you want a PC handheld
- It's worth looking for sales or on the used market to see what the competition is going for as well

#### New Or Refurbished?
- Both have warranties
- Refurbished stock usually gets sold out pretty fast and a lot of time can pass between re-stocks
- Refurbished offers best value though local used market could go even lower depending on region
- Refurbished comes in different packaging but most of the time the device itself looks like brand new (from user reports so far on r/SteamDeck)

### Hardware / Performance
- Valve has said many times that they will iterate slower with the Deck compared to the competition
- Newer AAA games are already pushing the limits or barely run at all (poor optimization and "weak" hardware don't mix together well)
- Lacking features:
    - External GPU support (without tinkering)
    - Variable refresh rate display
    - 2nd USB port

### Game / Software Compatibility (SteamOS / Linux vs Windows)
- Not all software is available or works under SteamOS (Linux)
    - Competitive games that have anti-cheats most likely don't work (eg. Call Of Duty, Fortnite)
    - Under SteamOS specifically flatpaks are the way to go limiting your choices even more (immutable distro)
- Modding games might be harder (specifically non-Steam-Workshop modding)
- Frame-generation isn't that good on Linux yet

### Need for portability
- If it would be mostly docked a console or a PC might be a better choice

### Other uses
- Media consumption, doing work etc...
    - Might benefit from a larger screen, built in keyboard or more ports which the Steam Deck lacks (unless a hub / dock is used)
